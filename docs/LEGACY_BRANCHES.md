# Legacy Branches

This repository keeps some legacy branches for historical reference.

## Do not merge

### `legacy/feature-ui-aurora-hero-motion-do-not-merge`

- **Status:** legacy / archived
- **Rule:** **DO NOT MERGE** into `main`
- **Why:** This branch contains a large, divergent set of changes (including extensive file moves/deletions) and is not aligned with the current repository structure and cleanup.
- **How to use it:**
  - Use it only for reference (copy/paste small, targeted ideas) and migrate changes manually into a fresh branch from `main`.
  - If you need anything from it, create a new branch off `main` and cherry-pick or re-implement only the minimal safe changes.

## Notes

- If a legacy branch is no longer needed for reference, it should be deleted to reduce confusion.
