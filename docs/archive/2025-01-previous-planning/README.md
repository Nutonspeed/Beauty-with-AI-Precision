# Archive: Previous Planning Documents (2025-01)

**Archive Date:** January 2025  
**Reason:** Documentation consolidation to establish single source of truth

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**These documents are SUPERSEDED and kept for historical reference only.**

DO NOT use these files for current project information. Refer to master documents instead:

### 📌 Master Documents (Single Source of Truth)

Located in repository root:

1. **[PROJECT_STATUS.md](../../../PROJECT_STATUS.md)** - Current system status and implementation reality
2. **[ROADMAP.md](../../../ROADMAP.md)** - Development roadmap with two future paths
3. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical architecture and design
4. **[DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](../../../DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Production deployment instructions

## Why These Documents Were Archived

### Problem Identified

During architectural review (January 2025), we discovered **54+ planning documents** created across multiple AI-assisted development sessions. These documents contained:

- ❌ **Conflicting completion percentages** (85%, 90%, 95%, 100%)
- ❌ **Multiple AI strategies** (Hugging Face Free vs AI Gateway vs VISIA Parity)
- ❌ **Inconsistent phase numbering** (Phase 1-14 vs Phase 1-5 vs Phase 1-8)
- ❌ **No acknowledgment** of current working implementation (Hugging Face tested successfully)
- ❌ **Duplicate deployment guides** (3+ versions with conflicting prerequisites)

### Root Cause

**Multiple AI sessions without coordination** led to overlapping roadmaps, status reports, and deployment guides. Each session created new planning documents without updating or deprecating previous ones.

### Solution Implemented

Created **4 master documents** (listed above) that:
- ✅ Reflect actual code reality (verified via comprehensive codebase scan)
- ✅ Document current working implementation (Hugging Face + 6 CV algorithms)
- ✅ Present clear future paths (MVP deploy vs accuracy upgrade)
- ✅ Provide single source of truth for deployment

## Historical Value

These documents contain valuable information about:

- ✅ **Development journey** - How the project evolved over time
- ✅ **Feature ideas** - Planned features for future consideration
- ✅ **Lessons learned** - What worked and what didn't
- ✅ **Testing insights** - Test results from various phases
- ✅ **Migration steps** - How Supabase migration was executed

**However, they should NOT be used for:**

- ❌ Understanding current system status
- ❌ Deployment instructions
- ❌ Technical architecture reference
- ❌ Future development planning

---

## How to Use This Archive

### ✅ Good Use Cases

**Research historical context:**
\`\`\`bash
# Search for when a feature was first planned
grep -r "treatment simulator" .
\`\`\`

**Understand previous decisions:**
\`\`\`bash
# Find why we chose Hugging Face
grep -r "Hugging Face" . | grep -i "decision\|choice\|select"
\`\`\`

**Extract valuable insights:**
\`\`\`bash
# Find all testing insights
grep -r "test result\|accuracy\|performance" .
\`\`\`

### ❌ Bad Use Cases

**Using for current status:**
\`\`\`bash
# DON'T do this - use PROJECT_STATUS.md instead
cat PHASE_14_COMPLETE.md  # ❌ Outdated
\`\`\`

**Following old deployment guides:**
\`\`\`bash
# DON'T do this - use DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md instead
cat DEPLOYMENT_FINAL_CHECKLIST.md  # ❌ Incorrect prerequisites
\`\`\`

**Planning based on old roadmaps:**
\`\`\`bash
# DON'T do this - use ROADMAP.md instead
cat AR_AI_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md  # ❌ Conflicting strategy
\`\`\`

## Migration History

**Before Consolidation:**
- 64 planning documents (root + docs/ + docs/phases/ + supabase/)
- Multiple conflicting versions
- No single source of truth
- Confusion about actual completion %

**After Consolidation:**
- 4 master documents (root level)
- Clear project status (90-95% complete)
- Accurate AI strategy (Hugging Face current, upgrades optional)
- Unified deployment guide

**Archived Files:** 60 documents (preserved in this folder)

**Kept in Main Docs:**
- API_DOCUMENTATION.md
- ACCESS_CONTROL_*.md
- AR_AI_FEATURES.md (reference for implemented features)
- AI_GATEWAY_SETUP.md (reference for future upgrade)
- Technical guides that don't conflict with master docs

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

1. **No coordination between AI sessions** - Each session created new plans without checking existing ones
2. **No deprecation strategy** - Old documents never marked as outdated
3. **No single source of truth** - Multiple "master" documents competing
4. **No validation against code** - Documentation claims didn't match code reality

### What We Fixed

1. ✅ Created 4 master documents as single source of truth
2. ✅ Validated claims against actual codebase (comprehensive scan)
3. ✅ Archived conflicting documents (this folder)
4. ✅ Established clear navigation (docs/README.md)

### Best Practices Going Forward

- 📌 **Always update master documents** instead of creating new ones
- 📌 **Validate claims against code** before documenting completion
- 📌 **Archive outdated docs immediately** when superseded
- 📌 **Keep single source of truth** for each topic (status, roadmap, architecture, deployment)

## Questions?

**"Can I still reference these documents?"**  
Yes, for historical context only. But always verify against master documents.

**"Should I update these documents?"**  
No. They are frozen for historical reference. Update master documents instead.

**"Can I delete these documents?"**  
Not recommended. They contain valuable historical context and development journey insights.

**"What if I find useful information here?"**  
Extract the relevant information and add it to appropriate master document or create a new technical guide in main docs/ folder.
